editor_description = "A Generic Attack.
A Common use would be to use a timer or animation and connect it's end signal to the Cancel function of this attack.
It is also possible to make this attack cancel when it hits terrain by toggling on CancelOnOtherBody and turning on the maskbit for terrain on this attack.
Also, don't forget to add a collision. I mean. You do have a big warning in the scene tree panel but you never know."
